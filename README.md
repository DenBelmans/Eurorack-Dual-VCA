# Eurorack-Dual-VCA
An 8hp dual VCA module for Eurorack. Based on Electricdruids 'Vintage VCA'. You can learn everything about the schematic on their blog: https://electricdruid.net/design-a-eurorack-vintage-vca-with-the-lm13700/

This is my first Eurorack module, I hope there are many more to come!
If you try this out, feel free to contact me with questions, critique, or send me some pictures of the finished product!

If there are any issues with any of the files, please contact me. I made this before I knew I would be sharing everything online.

***** BUILD INSTRUCTIONS *****

To make your lifes easier I have updated the silkscreen to include the component values.
While soldering the headers, I recommend you stack the pcb's with the unsoldered headers mated in between. Then fix the PCBs together with the standoffs and screws to keep things together. Then solder the connectors.
When installing the front panel, make sure the text on the panel is oriented in the same direction as the text on the PCBs. Otherwise things will not work as expected. In future designs I will try to make the panel non-symmetrical.

***** HISTORY *****

31/12/2020: First tests showed some issues with the design which were solved before uploading the files to GitHub, though the current files are not tested yet, this will likely happen later this month when I place a new order for PCBs.

20/01/2021: I have changed a few small things and will be ordering the current PCB design in the next week. I will update this description once I have tested it and confirmed that everything works as intended, no reversed pots or switched jacks :)

07/02/2021: As of today everything in this repository is finalized and tested. Feel free to place orders for PCBs with the provided gerbers or make changes using the KiCAD files!

07/03/2021: I updated the gerbers and kicad files again. Now the component values will be printed on the PCBs in silkscreen for easier assembly!
