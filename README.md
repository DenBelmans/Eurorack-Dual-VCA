# Eurorack-Dual-VCA
An 8hp dual VCA module for Eurorack. Based on Electricdruids 'Vintage VCA'.

This is my first Eurorack module, I hope there are many more to come!
If you try this out, feel free to contact me with questions, critique, or send me some pictures of the finished product!

If there are any issues with any of the files, contact me, I made this before I knew I would be sharing everything on here.

31/12/2020: First tests showed some issues with the design which were solved before uploading the files to GitHub, though the current files are not tested yet, this will likely happen later this month when I place a new order for PCBs.
